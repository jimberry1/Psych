# PSYCH

Welcome to Psych, the interactive Quiz game. I decided to make this app a project to improve my skills 
in Typescript and PWA's, with the side effect of having a great game I'm able to play with friends

#Game Concept
The game centers around personalised questions that players must provided the funniest answers to. Each question is tailored
to the lobby, whereby variables in the question will be replaced by a random player's name. 
After answering the questions players then vote on what they believe to be the best answer.
Finally the scores are tallied and the process repeats until a winner is decided. 

#Features
